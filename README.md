Github Guide Project
My name is Jonathan Yang and welcome to my Github. 
I am a soon to be Computer Science graduate at Davenport University and my passion and goal is to become a professional software engineer. This profile will be my portofilio to show to current and future potential employers. It will also be a way in how I will document my work and the project in which I have contributed on. 
Through my studies I have experience creating simple applications using Java and C#. I also have experience in implementing simple to complex algorithms and data-structures from course homework, such as Data structures/Algorithm design and analysis. 
In my own time, which I have not been able to document here, I have experience with other programming languages such as: VBScript, C++, C, Python, SQL, HTML/HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Swift and frameworks such as Spring and MEAN.

  Rewriting old static automation scripts to be data driven.
  Writing new automation scripts
  Authored test cases using User Stories
  Defect & Bug discovery
  Established clear and concise traceability matrix for test cases-defects-user stories
  Performing manual testing (functional/regression/exploratory/black-box)
  Performing automation testing (Developing scripts using HP UFT)
  Performing performance testing (HP LoadRunner)
While doing QA work I also pursued development work which includes:
  Using Java to fix defects in maintenance projects.
